## Description

Rainydays marked the beginning of my web development journey as it was the first website I created.  I designed an online store for a fictional outdoor apparel brand. Catering to adventure-loving men and women aged 30 to 50, the site was initially developed using HTML and CSS for a sleek look. Later, I enhanced it with JavaScript and integrated WordPress as a content managment system (CMS), making product management both efficient and user-friendly. It was an exciting project that combined style with functionality for those passionate about outdoor activities.

- Responsive Design: The website is adaptable to all screen sizes using Flexbox and CSS Grids, without CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.
- Semantic HTML: Clean, semantic HTML for structure clarity and SEO.
- DRY CSS: Applied DRY principle in CSS for efficient, maintainable code.
- WCAG Compliance: Focused on accessibility, making the site WCAG compliant.
- Unique Meta Tags: Each page features unique meta, title, and h1 tags for better SEO.
- Wordpress: REST API from Wordpress with plugin woocommerce. [REST API server](https://rainydays.cmsbackendsolutions.com/)
