Rainydays marked the beginning of my web development journey as it was the first website I created.  I designed an online store for a fictional outdoor apparel brand. Catering to adventure-loving men and women aged 30 to 50, the site was initially developed using HTML and CSS for a sleek look. Later, I enhanced it with JavaScript and integrated WordPress as a content managment system (CMS), making product management both efficient and user-friendly. It was an exciting project that combined style with functionality for those passionate about outdoor activities.


## Description
The journey of this project started with laying out its design in Figma, where i focused on creating the visual blueprint. Following this, the coding began, relying exclusively on HTML and CSS to bring the design to life. As the project advanced, i utilized WordPress REST API, and hosted it to a server. During this phase, i also integrated JavaScript for dynamically retrieving and showcasing products. This stage also offered us a deeper dive into WordPress's capabilities, particularly in experimenting with various plugins like E-commerce.
