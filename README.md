1.decided to use flexbox all over my website to be confident using flexbox, next html/css assigment i would dive in deeper to css grid. 
2. chrome is my choice of web browser, and i found out that my designe looks sligthely different in safari, for exampel my search button hight is different, so it shows the div behind it when i use safari. 
3. i know one of my image is 800kb, but couldn't compress it more then this.
