1.decided to use flexbox all over my website to be confident using flexbox, next html/css assigment i would dive in deeper to css grid. 
2. chrome is my choice of web browser, and i found out that my designe looks sligthely different in safari, for exampel my search button hight is different, so it shows the div behind it when i use safari. 
3. i went trough the moduels and watched some youtube for how to set up layout, as mentioned i used alot of flexbox. at the end of my assigment i feel confident using flexbox. im still not sure if my elements are semantically correct.
when i was going through focus for keyboard navigation i had a little problem with my anchors. almost every picture or text have margin/paddings, and focus looks weird when i tab through my website
